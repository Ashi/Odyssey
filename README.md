Odyssey
=======

Welcome to project Odyssey, a 2D Slick-based game skeleton created to provide a framework for new developers while also furthering my experience with programming and computer science related methodology. Please understand that this software by no means will provide flawless application, as design flaws are always prone to occur in development. Use this software at your own discretion, as I am not responsible for any expections that are not met or any inconveniences that occur.
